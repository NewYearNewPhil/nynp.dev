# Hello World!
Hi there! This post starts off my personal blog. You can expect to find interesting entries
about software development and related fields. However, please do not expect any sort of consistency -
this is a hobby project and I will likely only work on it during random bursts of energy.

## About Me
My name is Philipp Allweyer, going as *NewYearNewPhil*. At the time of writing this, I am 25 years old
and currently working on my Masters degree in applied computer science at [HTW Saar](https://www.htwsaar.de/).

I have a lot of experience troughout the entire web development stack as well as some basic
applied knowledge of machine learning. I was one of the co-founders of [alocalo](https://www.saarbruecker-zeitung.de/saarland/saar-wirtschaft/saarlaendisches-start-up-alocalo-will-amazon-die-stirn-bieten_aid-72313171),
a startup focusing on providing local alternatives to users while they are shopping online. Sadly, even though in 2022
we were able to secure funding via the [EIC Accelerator](https://www.dorucon.de/dorucon-sichert-saarlaendischem-start-up-alocalo-millionenhohe-foerderung-aus-bruessel/),
alocalo ultimately didn't work out and we were forced to [file for insolvency](https://www.sr.de/sr/home/nachrichten/politik_wirtschaft/insolvenz_startup_alocalo_saarland_100.html).

Nowadays I'm focusing on my studies and working on various side projects (like this one!) in my spare time.

## nynp.dev Stack
Given that this blog is aimed at fellow software engineers, I'll share some details on the setup of this page. Even though
the page is explicitly simple, some of the details might be interesting for readers.

nynp.dev is built with the framework [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [React](https://react.dev/). Astro is essentially
a static site generator that is able to integrate components written in other web frameworks, or components following the
WebComponent standard. While Astro also supports Server Side Rendering (dubbed "on demand"), this page currently doesn't require it.
Astro is packed full of amazing features, definitively check it out. For example, I'm defining the content of all pages
in Markdown - big fan of that.

I used React for the dynamic parts - React components are rendered during site generation, only its resulting output is
shipped to the browser (without any javascript). Those components are then hydrated in the browser as needed - critically, after
the First Content Paint.

For styling, I rely on the amazing [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework with its many utility functions.
Design inspiration stems from Casey Neistat's [website](https://www.caseyneistat.com/) - not because I'm particularly fond
of him, but I'm a fan of the extremely minimalistic approach to conveying information.

The website is eventually compiled into plain HTML, CSS & JS, which is uploaded to and hosted by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
That way, I don't ever need to worry about where & how to host it, at the cost of relying on a US entity.

## What's Next?
At the same time as this introductory post, my first "real" blog post is going live, where I demonstrate a cool way
to handle diagrams. It's very cool, I promise! Check it out [here](/logs/excalidraw-vscode-dx/).

Apart from that, no promises - we'll see.
