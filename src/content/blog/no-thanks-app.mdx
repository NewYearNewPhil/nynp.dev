# No, Thanks!

I am painfully addicted to short video content. A few months ago, I fell into the trap of installing TikTok onto my phone to see what the fuss is all about and lost countless hours of my life. One day I realized how stupid it all is, and uninstalled the app again. Ever since I'm free of TikTok, but my troubles aren't over - I discovered Instagram Reels and it all went downhill again, very rapidly.

My brain won't let me uninstall Instagram though, that's where I see what my friends are up to! At the same time, it is powerless to stop my undisciplined self from swiping trough endless videos, mindlessly, forever.

Talking to some of the aforementioned friends that suffer from similar impairments, one of them introduced me to an app called "[NoScroll](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newswarajya.noswipe.reelshortblocker)" which can straight up block short video content from Instagram and YouTube, basically disabling these features. Exactly what I needed! Unfortunately it comes with some anti-features I don't like, such as ads, a "premium" upgrade, notifications and many more. I don't want to give an app with these features the level of control over my phone as it requires.

So I coded up just the basic features - blocking Reels and Shorts - on my own. This was my first native Android development experience, and it was miserable. I don't like Jetpack Compose, but I managed to throw something together, with a very simple UI that does only what it needs. You can find the source code as well as the `.apk` file on [Github](https://github.com/NewYearNewPhil/nothanks).

Just like NoScroll, it requires to be set as an "accessibility service" in the Android settings. I'm not happy with this, but I was unable to find a different way to get that kind of control over other apps, and in a way not being able to stop myself from using features I have could be considered some kind of mild disability, so I guess it's fine.

I'm not sure whether anyone else cares about this, for normal people NoScroll is probably the better way to go, if anyone is privacy focused in the same way, maybe my app helps them out.

That's all from my end - till next time!
