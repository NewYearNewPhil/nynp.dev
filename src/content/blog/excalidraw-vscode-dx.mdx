# Experiments on Excalidraw, VS Code & the flexibility of SVG
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a browser based diagramming tool with a focus on simplicity and has a charming look to it in my personal opinion.
I prefer it to something like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) because it's not designed to create professional, scientific diagrams, but instead serves as a whiteboard replacement.
It just feels really nice to use.

Excalidraw has one feature that makes it stand out from the competition: When exporting images from it (`.png` or `.svg`), it can embed its "scene" into the image. That way, if images
exported from Excalidraw are distributed somewhere, it's possible to just take this exported imaged, load it into Excalidraw and edit the diagram.
For developers like myself, the [Excalidraw extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) further improves on that feature by abstracting away the manual export.
Files named `<name>.excalidraw.svg` or `<name>.excalidraw.png` can be opened and edited with the Excalidraw extension. When saving the diagram, the file is replaced by a newly exported version, including the scene information.

For my made up use case (integrating diagrams into a website), this is a perfect fit: My diagrams live in the websites source code as `.svg` files. When I make changes to the diagram using the Excalidraw extension,
the file system watcher of my build tool recognizes the change and *hot-reloads* the page. That way, I can work on a blog post in its entirety (text & diagrams), having an always up to date live preview.

However, there are some limitations with this workflow:
- No fonts (the exported svg refers to local `.woff2` files which the browser doesn't have)
- No support for Dark Mode
- No inline editing in the web

With that said, let's get to working around these limitations. I'll be experimenting directly in this website, which is built using Astro and React (see [Hello World](/logs/hello-world/)), but the approach is universal.

## Fonts
SVGs contain references to the fonts used in `<text>` elements. There seem to be two default fonts: `Virgil` and `Cascadia`.
In the exported SVG, those fonts are referenced using file urls like this (URL shortened):
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Virgil";
    src: url("https://file%2B.vscode-resource");
}
```

I *could* have a look at the VS Code extension and improve it by adding a CDN fallback for the fonts, but since I want to avoid
users having to load files from some random CDN, I opted to include the font files in my website and reference them by
replacing the respective url strings in the SVG. Basically like this:
```js
styleElement.textContent = styleElement.textContent.replace(
    /font-family: "Virgil";\s*src: url\("https:\/\/file%2B\.vscode-resource\.vscode-cdn\.net\/[^\)]+"\)/,
    'font-family: "Virgil"; src: url("/fonts/Virgil.woff2")'
);
```

In theory, that's all that's required to correctly load the required fonts. However, because I haven't changed the extension
itself and definitively want to avoid pre-processing my SVGs, I opted to do this on the fly. First, I load the SVG file as text.
Then, I do the font replacement (and while we're at it, I change its width to 100% so it looks nicer). Finally, I render
the SVG on the page using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This forces me to trust myself to not inject anything malicious,
but I think I can handle that risk.

## Dark Mode
SVGs are just weird HTML, so this actually turned out to be fairly simple as the main requirement is already fulfilled:
The SVG is already present directly in the rendered HTML (as opposed to within an `<img>` tag), so this small CSS snippet does the trick:
```css
# needed !important for specificity reasons (the style in the SVG is inline)
.svg rect {
    fill: #13151a !important;
}

.svg text, .svg g {
    fill: #ffffff !important;
}

.svg g path {
    stroke: #ffffff !important;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    .svg rect {
        fill: #ffffff !important;
    }
    
    .svg text, .svg g {
        fill: #000000 !important;
    }

    .svg g path {
        stroke: #000000 !important;
    }
}
```
This works well for all simple diagrams that rely on the default text / line color. Custom styled texts and things like that are not
included yet, their color will just be overriden. This is a little different to how Excalidraw itself handles dark mode, but it'll do for now.

Here's a screen recording of what the development workflow now looks like:

## Inline Editing
To put the cherry on top, I felt it was a nice feature to allow visitors to directly play around with the diagrams,
without leaving the page. I've integrated the Excalidraw editor ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw)) directly onto the web page, where it's activated by clicking
on a diagram. Try it yourself by clicking on this diagram:
<ExcalidrawViewer src={test.src} client:visible />
I'd like to point out that the JS required to display the Excalidraw editor is only loaded once, no matter
how many editors are opened on a page. Also, this JS is only loaded when it is actually required - if you don't click on
the diagram, only the SVG is loaded to save your precious bandwidth. Changes made in this mode aren't persisted,
but you can export the image from the editor.

Pretty cool, no?
